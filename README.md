This directory contains the sample Terraform code to create a Power virtual server instance image. 

To create your own Power virtual server instance image, you should fork this repository and then modify the local variable `stock_image_name` in the file `main.tf` to reference your own publicly availble image.

## Before you begin

  1. Verify that your custom image is publicly available in all supported regions.
  2. Verify that you have Manager service access role for IBM Cloud Schematics.
  3. Review and Verify the Identity and Access Management (IAM) information at [Managing Power Systems Virtual Servers (IAM)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-managing-resources-and-users).

## Required resources

  * Create a Power Systems Virtual Server Instance. For more information, see [Getting started with IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-started).  
  * Create a public and private SSH key that you can use to securely connect to your Power Systems Virtual Server. To create a public and private SSH key, see [Adding an SSH key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ssh-keys?topic=ssh-keys-adding-an-ssh-key).
  * You cannot create a private network during the VM provisioning process. You must first use the Power Systems Virtual Server user interface, command line interface (CLI), or application programming interfaced (API) to [create one](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-configuring-subnet).
  
## Installing the software

To install the software, configure the following required variables:
  * Select a Power Systems Virtual Server Instance
  * Enter a name for the new image instance that is being created
  * Enter an SSH Key Name for the selected server instance
  * Enter a Network Name or ID for the selected server instance.  

If necessary, modify the optional configuration items related to [memory](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/pi_instance#pi_memory), [processors](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/pi_instance#pi_processors), [processor type](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/pi_instance#pi_proc_type), [storage type](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/pi_instance#pi_storage_type) and [system type](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/pi_instance#pi_sys_type).
